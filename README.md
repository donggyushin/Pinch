## SwiftUI Gestures

The main learning topic of this short and engaging iOS project is to get familiar with almost every SwiftUI gesture, such as long-press gesture, double-tap gesture, drag gesture, and magnification gesture (a gesture that recognizes a magnification motion and tracks the amount of it). The only gesture that we will not cover in this tutorial is the rotation gesture.

## SwiftUI Materials

We can apply a blur effect (with color vibrancy) to a view that appears behind another view by adding a material with the background modifier. The new SwiftUI material is not a view, but adding material is like inserting a translucent layer between the modified view and its background.
